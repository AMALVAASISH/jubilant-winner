in brute force approach, the array is first sorted and then a comaprison is made such that
it is checked if the next element is +1 greater than the current element, if not we have found the missing number

but this is not optimal, because sorting is O(nlogn)

optimal approach 

we always know the pattern of the data, so we can find the missing number, by subtracting the sum of n numbers and the numbers
in the array
