non decreasing sorted order - [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6] (not necessary that the next elements have to be increasing, can have duplilcates)

in place - so we dont have to create a new array

in this, we are using two pointers, one to identify the unique elements and other to mark the position of the unique element to perform the in place shifting
