non decreasing order means that it is increasing and can have duplicates

first approach
copy the elements of the second array to the first array and do a sort

this is the brute force approach
for adding the time complexity is O(m+n) and for sorting , the best is (m+n)log(m+n)

so this is not a good time complexity, so we have to think of a better time complexity and approach


2nd approach

took pic of the solution, check in mobile
there are two pointers used for checking the values , one in the copy of the first array and second in the second array and then lower 
value is added to the original array

time complexity - O(n+m)
space complexity - O(m)

since extra space is used here, we have to find a better approach without using this extra space

code
------> check in index.js




3rd approach

this approach focuses on filling the elements in the original array in reverse order, by using the two pointers and comparing
