first approach

approach to solve this is using a hashmap(like a dictionary i think)

this has space complexity - O(n) and space complexity - O(n)

second approach

extra space will not be used

XOR operation is used(bitwise XOR)

check image in namaste dsa

read abt bitwise xor

remember: when you hear abt duplicates, either removing or anything, always use xor, it is an easy solution

space complexity: O(0)
time complexity: O(n)

every element appears twice or there are duplicates, you can use bitwise xor
