time complexity

it is used to measure the efficiency of algo in terms of speed as the input size grows

low time complexity, better efficiency(speed)

time complexity is not time taken


big O notation is used to represnt worst case time complexity 

the three famous big O notations are

O(n) , O(log n), O(n*2), O(n log n)

O(n log n) -> example (merge sort)

space complexity(how much extra space are u using)
